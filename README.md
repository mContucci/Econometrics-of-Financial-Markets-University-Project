## Project Overview
This project was undertaken as a part of a university assignment in the course "Econometrics of Financial Markets." It was an intensive task where I was given a week to complete the project. The primary focus of the project was to apply various econometric models to analyze financial markets.

## Data
The data used in this project are simulated. They were generated to resemble real-world financial data while maintaining the educational purpose of the assignment.

## Methods/Models Employed
Several advanced econometric models were utilized in this project, including:
- **ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average)**: This model was used for understanding and predicting future points in a series.
- **VAR (Vector Autoregression)**: Employed for capturing the linear interdependencies among multiple time series.
- **VECM (Vector Error Correction Model)**: This model helped in understanding the long-term relationship between highly integrated time series.
- **Cointegration Analysis**: It was used to find the long-term equilibrium relationships between time series.

## Objective
The main objective of this project was to gain hands-on experience with these econometric models and apply them in a simulated financial market scenario. The project aimed to provide practical insights into the complexities of financial data analysis and the effectiveness of various econometric tools.

## Disclaimer
This project is purely academic and part of a university course requirement. The data and analysis are for educational purposes only and should not be used for real-world financial decision-making.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude to my professors and peers at the university who provided guidance and support throughout this project.
